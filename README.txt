d3.py: Because I cannot install d3py on python3, I test this file in python2. Hope it can run in your computer with python3 and d3py.
So just run this file. Firstly it will generate every_years'_juvenile_crime_numbers' line graph. Then you should enter control+c and this file will generate districts_crime_number's line graph.(I was going to draw a bar graph but failed. Original code is from github's example so it is real confusing)
This file is related to snapshots juvenile_crime_number_d3.png and district_crime_number.png


CrimeAndMethods.py:  Produce a pie chart about number of crime and the methods by Plotly(gun, knife and others).

Juve.py: Use the juvenilearrests.csv, compute and add some information into it and create a scatter plot with Plotly. Finally output a new csv file.
The modified csv is called juvenile_district.csv.

felony.py: Because we regard the suspects under 20 years old as juveniles, we add a new attribute isJuvenile into this csv. 
The modified csv is felony2016_IsJuvenile.

juvenile_plotly.pyï¼šThis file is to use plotly to draw the line plot about the relationship between the average number of juvenile crime and months.
