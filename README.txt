CrimeAndDistrict.py: Just run this file and this file will use crime2017_cleaned_preprocessed.csv, compute safety value we define ourselves and add this values to a new column.

d3.py: Because I cannot install d3py on python3, I test this file in python2. Hope it can run in your computer with python3 and d3py. So just run this file. Firstly it will generate every_years'_juvenile_crime_numbers' line graph. Then you should enter control+c and this file will generate districts_crime_number's line graph.(I was going to draw a bar graph but failed. Original code is from github's example so it is real confusing)
